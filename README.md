Creating curriculum
==========

Our students run through lessons in a three step process. 

* Read through the material on a topic in the wiki on Github
* Complete an exercise on a browser-based IDE called [Cloud 9](https://c9.io/)
* Take a quiz via a form on Google Docs

1. **Material**: Wiki page material on a concept should be readable in under 15 minutes. The page should be written for absolute newbies, and if it's a page on code, list syntax at the top, then a table of contents, then concepts by header.  

   [Check out this example](https://github.com/OperationSpark/variables-and-constants/blob/master/README.md).

   Table of contents generator is [here](https://github.com/thlorenz/doctoc) 

2. **Cloud9 Exercise**: You should provide an exercise with anything that has syntax or markup. Create a simple exercise that practices the concepts outlined in the page.  So, if it's on loops, a simple exercise on JavaScript loops.

3. **Quiz**:  15 questions or less. If applicable, try to break up the quiz into sections using headers. This will help us give remedial help by targeting weaknesses in that particular area, ie, you understand what variables are, but you're struggling with keywords. No need to write the quiz from scratch. You can copy the [starter template](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1MF5h5uIssiqcpy_I-gyOEgLn5VvmT3_XMPqwNtSE_xk/viewform?edit_requested=true) in Google Docs by clicking File > Make a Copy. 

Once you've created the excercise and quiz, go back to the wiki page and add the links to them at the bottom. You'll need to change the hrefs to your wiki page on Github and the "send form" link for the Google Doc form.

Once you're done, please link to your work for review by posting it in the developers channel on [Operation Spark's Slack](https://operationspark.slack.com/). If you don't have a Slack account for Operation Spark yet please email max@operationspark.org to get set up. 

#### State of Wiki

To see what pages are yet to be owned, [open the wiki ownership doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1k7-oF_8ItWGHWN_CmUzNhqTRuy3g2Bl1-P2JSUoACFM/edit#gid=0).

The [developer playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iWceCMdFMKs3vRl69VptP0fbnurvtSNVkiUR13-GwSc/edit?usp=sharing) outlines how to write material for the wiki and includes the starter quiz form template.
